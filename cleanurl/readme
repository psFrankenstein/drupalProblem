if you have a problem of clean url in drupal 
eg .url you have (abc.com/?q=home)
want a clean url like (abc.com/home)
try to enable clean url from admin/config in drupal  
if you have somthing like this
Use URLs like example.com/user instead of example.com/?q=user.

Clean URLs cannot be enabled. If you are directed to this page or to a Page not found (404) error after testing for clean URLs, see the online handbook.

and it always fails clean url test
then you have to add given .htaccess file to your drupal root directory and you good to go
